## Starting from scratch

This is the start of something deliberate. I’ve tinkered here and there, explored topics out of curiosity, but starting today I’m formally documenting my growth as a hacker. The goal is to track skills, thoughts, mistakes, and breakthroughs—raw and real. I will be writing these blogs in English since this is the industry language.

Right now, I’d describe my level as “cybersecurity student” I’ve got the foundational curiosity and a scattered set of skills, but this diary is about turning that into focused momentum and finding my lane in cyber. I want to combine everything into one place, so it becomes more clear, what I'm trying and learning.

### Format to implement

I want to implement a format for these posts. I'll write an post every week—whether it’s a success, a stuck point, a random tool I explored, or even a mental block. Doesn’t matter. The only rule is: write and reflect. Some times more, sometimes not much at all.

Also I will introduce a small goal for myself every month. This way I can track my progress easily and build a track.

### End notes

This diary is about building direction. The industry is huge, and it's easy to drift. I’m starting this now to carve my own path, track the breadcrumbs, and learn out loud. Whether I stick to red teaming, blue teaming, or something in between—this will help me get there with intent.

ps. if anyone ever ends up reading these, let me know.
