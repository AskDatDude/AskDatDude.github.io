                        cybersecurity. The goal was to containerize a hacking platform called WebGoat using Docker. The
                        project was a great learning experience, as it allowed me to get hands-on experience with
                        containerization and learn more about how Docker works.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web
                    application security lessons. The project is a great way to learn about common web application
                    vulnerabilities and how to prevent them. <br><br> WebGoat is a Java web application that contains a
                    number of
                    lessons that cover topics such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more. The lessons are
                    designed to be hands-on and interactive, allowing users to learn by doing. WebGoat is a great tool
                    for
                    anyone looking to learn more about web application security, whether you are a developer, tester, or
                    security professional.

                <h2 class="big-card-header" id="how-does-it-work">&#10008; Why run it on Docker?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and run applications in isolated
                    environments called containers. By running WebGoat on Docker, you can easily deploy and run the
                    application on any system that supports Docker, without having to worry about dependencies or
                    configuration issues. This makes it easy to set up and run WebGoat in a consistent and reproducible
                    way, which is important when working with security tools like WebGoat.<br><br> Docker also provides
                    security benefits by isolating the application in its own container, which helps prevent
                    vulnerabilities in the application from affecting the host system. This is especially important when
                    working with insecure applications like WebGoat, as it helps protect the host system from potential
                    attacks.<br><br> Overall, running WebGoat on Docker is a great way to simplify the deployment and
                    management of the application, while also providing security benefits that help protect the host
                    system from potential attacks. And to me personally it was easy to learn and understand how Docker
                    works.

                <h2 class="big-card-header" id="how-does-it-work">&#10008; What did I really learn?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Some modules I did on WebGoat were [A3] SQL Injection, [A7] Identity & Auth Failure and [A9] Logging
                    security.
                    I learned how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, how to bypass authentication controls, and
                    how to
                    log spooffing and log bleeding work. I also learned how to use tools like ZAP to identify and
                    exploit
                    vulnerabilities in web applications.
                </p>


                <h2 class="big-card-header" id="conclusion">&#10008; Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Right now I am still doing WebGoat modules and learning more about cybersecurity. I am also learning
                    more about Docker and how to use it in different projects. I am planning to do more projects like
                    this
                    in the future, as I believe that hands-on experience is the best way to learn about cybersecurity.
                    <br><br>Docker is a great tool for containerizing applications and simplifying the deployment
                    process. I personally
                    enjoyed working with Docker and WebGoat, and I look forward to using Docker in future projects.
